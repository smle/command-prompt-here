This adds an item named "Command Prompt Here" to the context menus of folders
in Windows Explorer which, when selected, opens a command prompt window with
the folder as the current directory.

To install, double-click "Command Prompt Here - Install.reg".
To uninstall, double-click "Command Prompt Here - Uninstall.reg".

By default, it uses %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe as the command interpreter.
Command Prompt Here also works with JP Software's 4NT; the Install.reg file
just needs to be modified to point to 4nt.exe instead.

Tip: You can right-click the system menu icon of a folder window to get to a
command prompt in that folder.
